Problem1: I dont have enough pins for LED 3x3 matrix
Arduino Workshop (myzen.co.uk)  how to multiplex leds
created my own library to control leds

Problem2:
problem with the led matrix. Added CLOCK!

small problems:
disconnected wires,
passing constant boolean to setMode() which created problems for bot to start the game
etc

checking win state
1) hard code
2) general

added easy then medium then PvP.


asked ChatGPT how to make TTT with NN. I don't want to google.


NEURAL NETWORKS

I need dataset where the board is given with the next move
Couldn't find dataset so i am going to make one.
Found the tic tac toe made with minimax.
Will edit it to make the bot vs bot and record their moves.



after using byte instead of int (4byte) for all integers in TTT.h and TTT.cpp, storage usage dropped from 6626 bytes to 6484 bytes! I dont use this now.

I used AIFES trained tic tac toe.
